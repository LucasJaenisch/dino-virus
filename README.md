# dino-virus

survival dino themed game

complete tasks to save yourself and make your escape from the dinossaur park

dino virus takes place in a dinossaur park where you are one of its employees, the recruit.
the people who work here are very devoted to their jobs and thankfull for having one
even if it is a constant death threat it is better than starving on the streets and live under a bridge, even if one of those things ate my arm!
the creatures that live in the park are no monsters just animals, like giant elephants or really big eagles that cant fly but can tear you apart, if you dont feed them.

Level 1: Offices (done)
	"Works a tutorial, learns how to do tasks and traverse levels, doors, etc"

Level 2: Velociraptor Feeder
	"Gets to know where the wild things are, I mean, the animals, everything looks good, they are just animals who eats big chunks of meat. But they go wild for no reason.

Level 3: Offices (again)
	"Re enter the place you were introduced now in chaos, people are half eaten and trying to crawl alive with the rest of the limbs they have. Try to escape throw the park.

Level 4: Incubation Lab

	The Spinossaurus lives in her lagoon, she is an apex predator when it comes to stealth, so silence is key here, don't make noise so she doens't notice you

# dino-virus

survival dino themed game

complete tasks to save yourself and make your escape from the facility

dino virus takes place in a dinossaur park where you are one of its employees.
the people who work here are very devoted to their jobs and thankfull for having one
even if it is a constant death threat it is better than starving on the streets and live under a bridge, even if one of those things ate my arm!
the creatures that live in the park are no monsters just animals, like giant elephants or really big eagles that cant fly but can tear you apart, if you dont feed them.
